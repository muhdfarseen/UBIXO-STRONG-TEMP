                          <h3 className="font-semibold text-base">Things to Keep in Mind – Before You Decide</h3>
                          <p>
                            Every business structure comes with its own unique requirements.
                            While both Free Zone and Mainland companies offer numerous
                            benefits, it’s helpful to be aware of a few practical
                            considerations so you can plan accordingly.
                          </p>

                          <h5 className="font-semibold mt-4">For Mainland Companies:</h5>
                          <ul>
                            <li>
                              <strong>Office Space Is a Must:</strong> To operate as a
                              mainland company, you are required to lease a physical office
                              (minimum 200 sqft). This adds to your operational footprint –
                              but also enhances your local presence and credibility among UAE
                              clients.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              <strong>More Government Interactions:</strong> Since mainland
                              businesses must register with various departments (DED,
                              Municipality, Labour Ministry, etc.), the setup involves more
                              paperwork. With UBIXO handling it all on your behalf, you can
                              focus on your business without delays.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              <strong>Annual Financial Audit:</strong> Mainland companies
                              must conduct a yearly financial audit. This ensures
                              transparency and positions your company strongly when applying
                              for loans, investors, or government contracts.
                            </li>
                          </ul>

                          <h5 className="font-semibold mt-4">For FreeZone Companies:</h5>
                          <ul>
                            <li>
                              <strong>Trade Within UAE Requires a Local Agent:</strong> Free
                              zone companies can’t directly trade in the UAE mainland. But
                              this also helps maintain focus on global markets and e-commerce,
                              which are fast-growing sectors in the region.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              <strong>Visa Allocation Is Capped:</strong> Each free zone
                              offers a set number of visa slots depending on your package. If
                              your team grows, you can always upgrade to a larger space or
                              additional visa quota — something UBIXO can easily assist with.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              <strong>Limited Public Visibility:</strong> Free zone companies
                              are not listed in public directories. While this protects
                              privacy, it may require additional marketing to establish brand
                              recognition locally.
